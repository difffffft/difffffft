人生最可悲的事情，莫过于胸怀大志，却又虚度光阴，聪明不足又习惯拖延，学历不高又不肯学习，不满意自己又自我安慰，这世上没有什么比叫醒自己更加困难。

想要什么就真的去付出，能坚持下去的自律都会变成你蜕变的契机，莫成思想上的巨人，行动上的矮子，每个人都有一个觉醒，但觉醒的早晚，决定个人的命运。

The most pathetic thing in life, nothing more than a great ambition, but also wasted time, not enough smart and habit of procrastination, not high and refused to learn, not satisfied with their own and self-congratulation, there is nothing in this world than to wake up more difficult.

What you want to really go to pay, can adhere to the self-discipline will become an opportunity for you to transform, not into a giant in thought, action on the dwarf, everyone has an awakening, but the awakening of the morning and evening, to determine the fate of the individual.
