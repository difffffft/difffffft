你一生追求的东西，其实一开始就在，一开始我就拥有世界上最珍贵的爱，这一年慢慢才明白，一生所求无非是爱与自由只是你后知后觉而已。

兜兜转转追寻一圈后，才发现那把钥匙早已握在手中，人无法同时拥有青春和对于青春的感受，有些东西要靠失去才证明它的珍贵。

Your life pursuit of things, in fact, at the beginning, at the beginning I have the world's most precious love, this year slowly only to understand, a lifetime of seeking nothing more than love and freedom is just your hindsight.

After going around in circles pursuing a circle, only to find that the key has long been held in the hand, people can not have both youth and for the feeling of youth, some things to rely on the loss of only to prove that it's precious.
